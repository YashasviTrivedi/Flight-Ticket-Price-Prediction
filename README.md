# Flight-Ticket-Price-Prediction

The flight ticket price prediction project employs machine learning models for accurate forecasting, benefiting both airlines and passengers. It involves data exploration, cleaning, and visualization, as well as feature engineering and model training, focusing on Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Decision Tree Regression. The Decision Tree model outperforms others on the test data. The project successfully provides insights into flight pricing dynamics. 
Future enhancements include integrating real-time data, exploring advanced techniques, and deploying the model for real-time predictions, with a crucial emphasis on continuous monitoring and retraining for sustained accuracy in the dynamic aviation industry.
